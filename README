Solution to Berkeley CS 198 NLP competition

Quick Start
1. all files in conversation.py, utils.py, datadir folder
2. use sklearn, nltk, spacy, rake_nltk as nlp modeling
3. look at conversation.py the respond method, (chatbot_simple.ipynb)
4. run `python main.py` test examples in test.txt

Next thing to do:
1. add more intent examples in chatbot.txt
2. remove my implementation for advanced command
3. add more test examples
4. train a spacy model for named entity detection and keyword detection
5. online version

Misc:
1. intent identification - add distinguish words like "how many" "?"
	- train name entity recognizer - https://github.com/explosion/spacy/blob/master/examples/training/train_ner.py
	- distinguish two sentence with key words
2. come up with more test examples
